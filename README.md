# Better-Basileus
I aim to revive and revitalize the Rhomaioi mod created by Markellus found here . This adds my own flavor of Byzantine mechanics and ports over some of the many features CK2 had in the Legacy of Rome DLC. You can follow my progress posted here, or within the github posted above.

Unfortunately Rhomaioi hasn't been updated since 1.3.2, because of this I'll need to build it from the ground up using the mod files as a template.
