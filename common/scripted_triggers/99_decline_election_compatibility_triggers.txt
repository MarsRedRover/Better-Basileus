# '99_' at the beginning of the file causes its triggers to be replaced by triggers with the same name that are located in files starting with '_'
# these values exist to be overwritten by other mods to enable compatibility checks and prevent error.log entries

# e.g.: is_historicinvasions_active = { always = no }
